    "\n",
    "### 1. Verify Python installation\n",
    "\n",
    "You mentioned Python is already installed. First, make sure it works correctly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "python3 --version   # or with Python 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If this prints a version number (e.g., `Python 3.11.x`), you are good to go. If both commands fail, download Python from its source: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Make sure you use Python 3, not an outdated Python 2 version.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Create a virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Before writing any code, we need a clean, reproducible environment. Python's built-in tool for this is **`venv`** (virtual environment). A virtual environment isolates your project's dependencies from the system-wide Python installation, avoiding version conflicts between projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why virtual environments matter:** Imagine Project A needs `numpy==1.21` and Project B needs `numpy==1.26`. Without isolation, only one version can be installed at a time. Virtual environments solve this completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Step-by-step setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Run these commands in your terminal (not inside the notebook):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# 1. Create a virtual environment named 'venv' in the project folder\n",
    "python3 -m venv venv\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Activate it\n",
    "#    On macOS / Linux:\n",
    "source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "#    On Windows (PowerShell):\n",
    "#    .\\venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Upgrade pip itself (good practice)\n",
    "pip install --upgrade pip\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Install packages needed for this course\n",
    "pip install jupyter matplotlib ipywidgets numpy pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Save dependencies to a file so others can reproduce your setup\n",
    "# Note: `pip freeze` does log your package version numbers to the CLI. We redirect it into a new file named requriements.txt with the `>` symbol.\n",
    "pip freeze > requirements.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. (Later) install from requirements.txt:\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip:** Always activate your venv before starting work. Your shell prompt will show `(venv)` when it is active."

    "## 1.5 Git Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a **distributed version control system**. Every developer has a full copy of the repository history. This makes collaboration, branching, and rollback easy and safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Repository (repo):** a directory tracked by Git, containing your project + full history\n",
    "- **Commit:** a snapshot of the project at a point in time, with a message describing what changed\n",
    "- **Branch:** an independent line of development (default: `main`)\n",
    "- **Remote:** a copy of the repo hosted elsewhere (e.g., GitHub, GitLab)\n",
    "- **Staging area (index):** files you've marked (`git add`) for inclusion in the next commit\n",
    "\n",
    "### The basic Git workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Working Directory  →  Staging Area  →  Local Repo  →  Remote Repo\n",
    "   (edit files)      (git add)       (git commit)    (git push)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Essential commands\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# --- Set up (once per machine) ---\n",
    "git config --global user.name  \"Your Name\"\n",
    "git config --global user.email \"you@example.com\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# --- Start a new project ---\n",
    "git init                        # initialise repo in current folder\n",
    "git clone <url>                 # clone an existing remote repo\n",
    "\n",
    "# --- Daily workflow ---\n",
    "git status                      # what has changed?\n",
    "git diff                        # show unstaged changes\n",
    "git add myfile.py               # stage a specific file\n",
    "git add .                       # stage everything (use carefully)\n",
    "git commit -m \"Add circle area calculator\"   # commit with a message\n",
    "\n",
    "# --- Sync with remote ---\n",
    "git remote add origin <url>     # link local repo to GitHub\n",
    "git push -u origin main         # push commits to remote\n",
    "git pull                        # fetch + merge remote changes\n",
    "\n",
    "# --- History ---\n",
    "git log --oneline               # compact history\n",

    "git reset HEAD myfile.py        # un-stage a file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Golden rule:** commit early, commit often. Small, focused commits with clear messages make debugging and collaboration much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `.gitignore`\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a file named exactly `.gitignore` (note the leading dot) in your project's root directory and paste the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Environments\n",
    "venv/\n",

    "Thumbs.db\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "VS Code provides built-in Git support for committing, pushing, and pulling changes. For this course, it is not required that you become a git-pro; however, we'd encourage you to familiarize yourself at least with the commands above and, if interested, have a deep dive at some git learning resources for instance, here: [https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=uk_en&demo=](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=uk_en&demo=)"
