    "\n",
    "- Understand Python's core data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `list` and `dict`\n",
    "- Use `print()`, `input()`, and f-strings for I/O\n",

    "console.log(true + true);  // → 2      (booleans silently treated as integers!)\n",

    "**Linting** is the process of automatically analysing your source code to detect style violations, potential bugs, and code-quality issues — without actually running the code. **Formatting** means automatically rewriting your code to conform to a consistent style (indentation, spacing, line length, etc.). Together, they save you from having to remember every PEP-8 rule by hand.\n",
