If you install everything globally (system-wide), all projects share the same package versions, which can easily lead to dependency conflicts when one project requires a different version than another. The Python solution to this problem is the use of **virtual environments** (`venvs`). A virtual environment is an isolated environment created specifically for one project, allowing you to use a specific Python version and install project-specific dependencies without affecting other projects. Within that environment, you can freeze the exact versions of all installed packages to ensure reproducibility and prevent conflicts.\n",
